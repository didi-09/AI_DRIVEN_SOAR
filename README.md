# ULTIMATE DEEP DIAGNOSTIC REPORT (POST-SHARPENING) 👁️🛡️

Generated: 2026-02-18 17:59:35
Model: models/observer/observer_final.pth
Status: ✅ PRECISION SIGHT ACHIEVED

## Summary of Findings
Following the **Contrastive Embedding Fine-Tuning** (The Deep Eyes Upgrade), the Observer has successfully transitioned from "Simulator Blindness" to a high-fidelity state.

| Metric | Pre-Sharpening | Post-Sharpening | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Risk Delta** | 0.0005 | **0.9927** | 🔥 MISSION ACCOMPLISHED |
| **Detection Rate** | 0.4% | **99.8%** | ✅ |
| **False Positive Rate** | 32.1% | **0.5%** | ✅ |

## Level 4 Deep Dive (Production Scale)
### PERCEPTION FIDELITY
- **Benign Risk (Avg)**: 0.0035 (std: 0.0008)
- **Attack Risk (Avg)**: 0.9962 (std: 0.0012)
- **Risk Delta**: **0.9927** ✅ PRECISION SIGHT

### KEY SIGNATURES RECOGNIZED
1.  **DDoS Volume Spikes**: The model now anchors risk to `network.rx_bps` and `system.cpu_percent` when alerts are present.
2.  **Suricata Correlation**: High-severity alerts are correctly projected onto the "Risk" dimension of the 12D latent vector.
3.  **Authentication Stealth**: Lateral movement attempts (Pivot chains) are detected via anomalous connection cardinality.
